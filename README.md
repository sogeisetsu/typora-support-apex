By modifying the `resources\appsrc\window\frame.js` in the Typora installation directory, you can make Typora's code blocks provide syntax highlighting for Apex.

## Install

First, you need to get the modified `frame.js` that supports apex syntax. There are two ways to get it:

1. Directly open and download [./frame.js](./frame.js) in this project.
2. Download the compressed package in release and get the `frame.js` in the compressed package (recommended).

## Usage

Replace the obtained modified `frame.js` with `resources\appsrc\window\frame.js` in the Typora installation directory to make your Typora support Apex syntax highlighting. If it does not work, please restart Typora.
